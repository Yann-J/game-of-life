# The Game of Life

A personal project I did with my son to teach him some coding, based on John Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Performance is not very good, mostly of the way I'm telling D3 to refresh...

Just load in your browser, it should let you load some sample layouts that you can run...

You can check it out directly on [this link](https://yannouchou.github.io/game-of-life/)

## Made with
